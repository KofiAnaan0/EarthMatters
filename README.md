## 💡 Inspiration
When I first Googled *“What happens if the Earth’s temperature rises by 2°C?”*, the answers were alarming.  
It made me realize that our planet’s future is at serious risk. I then checked *“What’s the current global temperature?”* and saw it was already around **1.5°C above pre-industrial levels**.  

This motivated me to create a solution that could **educate and empower people, especially the younger generation**, about climate change and sustainability.
